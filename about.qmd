*This is the website for the hands-on "R for Reproducibility" workshop taught at*
*Ohio State University on August 18^th^, 2025.*

### Practical information about the workshop

R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration,
visualization, and statistical analysis. 
During this workshop, participants will learn the basics of R and RStudio,
and how to use R for reproducible data manipulation and visualization.

If you are affiliated with Ohio State University in any capacity,
you can attend this workshop for free by
[registering here](https://library.osu.edu/events/r-for-scientific-reproducibility-virtual-event-1). You can find some more information about the workshop [here](https://imageomics.github.io/2025-08-15-osu-online/).

There are no prerequisites: this workshop is suitable for complete beginners
in R and in coding in general.
This workshop is taught online via Zoom.
