    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n1.1 The dplyr package and the tidyverse\nThe dplyr package provides very useful functions for manipulating data in data frames (“data wrangling”). In this session, we’ll cover the most commonly used ones:\n\nselect() to pick columns (variables)\nfilter() to pick rows (observations)\nrename() to change column names\narrange() to change the order of rows (i.e., to sort a data frame)\nmutate() to modify values in columns and create new columns\nsummarize() to compute across-row summaries\n\nAll these functions take a data frame as the input, and output a new, modified data frame.\ndplyr belongs to a family of R packages designed for “dataframe-centric” data science called the “tidyverse”. “Dataframe-centric” refers to doing most if not all data analysis while keeping the data in R’s data frame data structure. Another tidyverse package we’ll cover in today’s workshop is ggplot2 for making plots.\n\n\n1.2 Setting up\nUse a new script for this session – much like in the previous session:\n\nOpen a new R script (Click the + symbol in toolbar at the top, then click R Script)1.\nSave the script straight away as data-wrangling.R – you can save it anywhere you like, though it is probably best to save it in a folder specifically for this workshop.\nIf you want the section headers as comments in your script, like in the script I am showing you in the live session, then copy-and-paste the following into your script:\n\n\n\nSection headers for your script (Click to expand)\n\n\n# 1 - Introduction -------------------------------------------------------------\n# 1.3 - Loading the tidyverse\n\n# 1.4 - The gapminder dataset\n\n# 2 - select() to pick columns (variables) -------------------------------------\n\n# 3 - rename() to change column names ------------------------------------------\n\n# 4 - The pipe |&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 5 - filter() to pick rows (observations) -------------------------------------\n\n# Challenge 1\n# Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and include pipes) that\n# will produce a data frame that has lifeExp, country, and year for Africa but not\n# for other continents.\n# How many rows does your data frame have?\n\n# 6 - arrange() to sort data frames --------------------------------------------\n\n# 7 - mutate() to modify values in columns and create new columns --------------\n\n# Challenge 2\n# A: Use mutate() to create a new column called gdp_billion that has the absolute\n#    GDP (i.e., not relative to population size) and does so in units of billions\n#    (i.e., 2.3 would mean 2.3 billion).\n\n# B: (Bonus) Use mutate() to create a new column planet that has the value earth\n#    in every row. We didn’t cover this kind of scenario but go ahead and test \n#    your intuition!\n  \n# 8 - summarize() to compute group-wise summary stats --------------------------\n\n# Challenge 3\n# Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average\n# life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Loading the tidyverse\nAll core tidyverse packages can be installed and loaded with a single command. Since you should already have installed the tidyverse2, you only need to load it, which you do as follows:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThe output tells you which packages have been loaded as part of the tidyverse. (You don’t have to worry about the “Conflicts” section.)\n\n\n1.4 The gapminder dataset\nIn this session and the next one on data visualization, we will work with the gapminder dataset, which contains statistics such as population size for different countries across five-year intervals.\nThis dataset is available in a package of the same name, which you also should have already installed3. To load the package into your current R session:\n\nlibrary(gapminder)\n\nTake a look at the gapminder data frame that is now available to you:\n\ngapminder\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nYou can also use the View() function to look at the data frame. This will open a new tab in your editor pane with a spreadsheet-like look and feel:\n\nView(gapminder)\n# (Should display the dataset in an editor pane tab)\n\nThe gapminder data frame is a so-called “tibble”, which is the tidyverse variant of a data frame. The main difference is the nicer default printing behavior of tibbles: e.g. the data types of columns are shown, and only a limited number of rows are printed.\nEach row of this data frame contains statistics for a single country in a specific year (across five-year intervals between 1952 and 2007), with the following columns:\n\ncountry (stored as a factor, an alternative to character that can be used for categorical data)\ncontinent (stored as a factor)\nyear (stored as an integer)\nlifeExp (stored as an integer): the life expectancy in years\npop (stored as an integer): the population size\ngdpPercap (stored as a double): the per-capita GDP"

    "text": "4 The pipe (|&gt;)\nSo far, the examples applied a single dplyr function to a data frame, and simply printed the output (a new data frame) to screen.\nBut in practice, it is common to use several functions in succession to “wrangle” a dataframe into the format you want. For example, if you want to first select() one or more columns, and then rename() a column, you could:\n\ngapminder_sel &lt;- select(.data = gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap)\n\nrename(.data = gapminder_sel, gdp_per_capita = gdpPercap)\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 3\n    year country     gdp_per_capita\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1952 Afghanistan           779.\n 2  1957 Afghanistan           821.\n 3  1962 Afghanistan           853.\n 4  1967 Afghanistan           836.\n 5  1972 Afghanistan           740.\n 6  1977 Afghanistan           786.\n 7  1982 Afghanistan           978.\n 8  1987 Afghanistan           852.\n 9  1992 Afghanistan           649.\n10  1997 Afghanistan           635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nFor more elaborate editing, we could go on like we did above, successively assigning new data frames and moving on to the next step.\nBut there is a neater way of dong this, using so-called “piping” with a pipe operator (|&gt;). Let’s start by seeing a reformulation of the code above with pipes:\n\ngapminder |&gt;\n  select(year, country, gdpPercap) |&gt;\n  rename(gdp_per_capita = gdpPercap)\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 3\n    year country     gdp_per_capita\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1952 Afghanistan           779.\n 2  1957 Afghanistan           821.\n 3  1962 Afghanistan           853.\n 4  1967 Afghanistan           836.\n 5  1972 Afghanistan           740.\n 6  1977 Afghanistan           786.\n 7  1982 Afghanistan           978.\n 8  1987 Afghanistan           852.\n 9  1992 Afghanistan           649.\n10  1997 Afghanistan           635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nWhat happened here? We took the gapminder data frame, pushed (or “piped”) it into the select() function, and then in turn piped that output into the rename() function.\nYou can think of the pipe as “then”: take gapminder, then select, then rename. Using pipes involves less typing and is especially more readable than using successive assignments5.\nWhen using pipes, you no longer specify the input data frame with the .data argument, because the function now gets its input via the pipe (by default, the input goes to the function’s first argument).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor code readability, it is good practice to always start a new line after a pipe |&gt;, and to indent (by pressing Tab) the subsequent line(s)."

These conditions don’t have to be based on numeric comparisons:\n\n# Only keep rows where the value in the 'continent' column is 'Europe':\ngapminder |&gt;\n  filter(continent == \"Europe\")\n\n# A tibble: 360 × 6\n   country continent  year lifeExp     pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Albania Europe     1952    55.2 1282697     1601.\n 2 Albania Europe     1957    59.3 1476505     1942.\n 3 Albania Europe     1962    64.8 1728137     2313.\n 4 Albania Europe     1967    66.2 1984060     2760.\n 5 Albania Europe     1972    67.7 2263554     3313.\n 6 Albania Europe     1977    68.9 2509048     3533.\n 7 Albania Europe     1982    70.4 2780097     3631.\n 8 Albania Europe     1987    72   3075321     3739.\n 9 Albania Europe     1992    71.6 3326498     2497.\n10 Albania Europe     1997    73.0 3428038     3193.\n# ℹ 350 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to use two equals signs == to test for equality!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Filter based on multiple conditions\nIt’s also possible to filter based on multiple conditions:\n\ngapminder |&gt;\n  filter(continent == \"Asia\", year == 2007, lifeExp &gt; 80)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  country          continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Hong Kong, China Asia       2007    82.2   6980412    39725.\n2 Israel           Asia       2007    80.7   6426679    25523.\n3 Japan            Asia       2007    82.6 127467972    31656.\n\n\nBy default, multiple conditions are combined in a Boolean AND fashion. In other words, in a given row, each condition needs to be met for that row to be kept. Above, we showed the countries in Asia that had a life expectancy greater than 80 years in 2007.\nIf you want to combine conditions in a Boolean OR fashion, where only one of the conditions needs to be met, use a | between them:\n\n# Keep rows with a high life expectancy and/or a high GDP:\ngapminder |&gt;\n  filter(lifeExp &gt; 80 | gdpPercap &gt; 10000)\n\n# A tibble: 392 × 6\n   country   continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Argentina Americas   1977    68.5 26983828    10079.\n 2 Argentina Americas   1997    73.3 36203463    10967.\n 3 Argentina Americas   2007    75.3 40301927    12779.\n 4 Australia Oceania    1952    69.1  8691212    10040.\n 5 Australia Oceania    1957    70.3  9712569    10950.\n 6 Australia Oceania    1962    70.9 10794968    12217.\n 7 Australia Oceania    1967    71.1 11872264    14526.\n 8 Australia Oceania    1972    71.9 13177000    16789.\n 9 Australia Oceania    1977    73.5 14074100    18334.\n10 Australia Oceania    1982    74.7 15184200    19477.\n# ℹ 382 more rows\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Pipeline practice\nFinally, let’s practice once more with “pipelines” that use multiple dplyr verbs:\n\ngapminder |&gt;\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") |&gt;\n  select(year, country, gdpPercap) |&gt;\n  rename(gdp_per_capita = gdpPercap)\n\n# A tibble: 300 × 3\n    year country   gdp_per_capita\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1952 Argentina          5911.\n 2  1957 Argentina          6857.\n 3  1962 Argentina          7133.\n 4  1967 Argentina          8053.\n 5  1972 Argentina          9443.\n 6  1977 Argentina         10079.\n 7  1982 Argentina          8998.\n 8  1987 Argentina          9140.\n 9  1992 Argentina          9308.\n10  1997 Argentina         10967.\n# ℹ 290 more rows\n\n\n\n Challenge 1\nUse a single command (which can span multiple lines and include pipes) to produce a data frame with columns year, country, and lifeExp, only for countries in Africa.

Tabular plain text files can be stored using:\n\nA Tab as the column delimiter (often called TSV files, and stored with a .tsv extension)\nA comma as the column delimiter (often called CSV files, and stored with a .csv extension).\n\nTo practice writing and reading data to and from TSV files, The examples below use functions from the readr package. This package is part of the core tidyverse and therefore already loaded into your environment.\n\nWriting to files\nTo write the gapminder data frame to a TSV file, use the write_tsv() function with argument x for the R object and argument file for the file path:\n\nwrite_tsv(x = gapminder, file = \"gapminder.tsv\")\n\nBecause we simply provided a file name, the file will have been written in your R working directory8.\nIf you want to take a look at the file you just created, you can find it in RStudio’s Files tab and click on it, which will open it in the editor panel. Of course, you could also find it in your computer’s file browser and open it in different ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to write to a different folder on your computer? (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file argument to write_tsv() takes a file path, meaning that you can specify any location on your computer for it it in addition to its name.\nFor example, if you had a folder called results in your current working directory (directory is just another word for folder), you could put the file in there:\n\nwrite_tsv(x = gapminder, file = \"results/gapminder.tsv\")\n\nNote that a forward slash / as a folder delimiter will work regardless of your operating system (even though Windows natively delimits folder by a backslash \\).\nFinally, if you want to store the file in a totally different place than where you are now, note that you can also use so-called absolute (or “full”) paths like:\n\nwrite_tsv(x = gapminder, file = \"/Users/poelstra.1/Desktop/gapminder.tsv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading from files\nTo practice reading data from a file, use the read_tsv() function on the file you just created:\n\ngapminder_reread &lt;- read_tsv(file = \"gapminder.tsv\")\n\nRows: 1704 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \"\\t\"\nchr (2): country, continent\ndbl (4): year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nNote that the function is rather chatty by default, telling you how many rows and columns it read, and what their data types are. Let’s check the resulting object:\n\ngapminder_reread\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nThis looks good! Do note that the column’s data types are not identical to what they were (year and pop are saved as double rather than integer, and country and continent as character rather than factor). This is largely expected because that kind of metadata is not stored in a plain-text TSV, so read_tsv() will by default simply make best guesses as to the types.\nAlternatively, you could tell read_tsv() what the column types should be, using the col_types argument (with abbreviations f for factor, i for integer, d for double — run ?read_tsv for more info):\n\nread_tsv(file = \"gapminder.tsv\", col_types = \"ffidi\")\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo read and write CSV files instead, use read_csv() / write_csv() in the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 Counting rows with count() and n()\nA common operation is simply counting the number of observations for each group. The dplyr package comes with two related functions that help with this.\nFor instance, to check the number of countries included in the dataset for the year 2002, you can use the count() function. It takes the name of one or more columns to define the groups we are interested in, and can optionally sort the results in descending order with sort = TRUE:\n\ngapminder |&gt;\n    filter(year == 2002) |&gt;\n    count(continent, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Africa       52\n2 Asia         33\n3 Europe       30\n4 Americas     25\n5 Oceania       2\n\n\nIf you need to use the number of observations in calculations, the n() function is useful. It will return the total number of observations in the “current group” as applicable – for instance, to get the standard error of life expectancy per continent:\n\ngapminder |&gt;\n  group_by(continent) |&gt;\n  summarize(se_life = sd(lifeExp) / sqrt(n()))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent se_life\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa      0.366\n2 Americas    0.540\n3 Asia        0.596\n4 Europe      0.286\n5 Oceania     0.775\n\n\n\n\n9.3 Function name conflicts\nWhen you loaded the tidyverse, the output included a “Conflicts” section that may have seemed ominous:\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nWhat this means is that two tidyverse functions, filter() and lag(), have the same names as two functions from the stats package that were already in your R environment.\nThose stats package functions are part of what is often referred to as “base R”: core R functionality that is always available (loaded) when you start R.\nDue to this function name conflict/collision, for example, the filter() function from dplyr “masks” the filter() function from stats: that is, if you write a command with filter(), it will use the dplyr function and not the stats function.\nYou can still use a “masked” function, but you will need to preface it with its package name as follows: stats::filter().\n\n\n9.4 Learn more\nThe material in this page was adapted from this Carpentries lesson episode, which has a lot more content than we were able to cover today.\nRegarding data wrangling specifically, here are two particularly useful additional skills to learn:\n\nPivoting/reshaping — moving between ‘wide’ and ‘long’ data formats with pivot_wider() and pivot_longer(). This is covered in episode 13 of the focal Carpentries lesson.\nJoining/merging — combining multiple dataframes based on one or more shared columns. This can be done with dplyr’s join_*() functions – see for example this chapter in R for Data Science."

    "text": "1 The grammar of graphics\nThe package ggplot2 applies a framework for plotting such that any plot can be built from the same basic building blocks. This very popular package is based on a system called the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson which aims to create a grammatical rules for the development of graphics. It is part of a larger group of packages called “the tidyverse.”\nThe “gg” in ggplot stands for “grammar of graphics” and all plots share a common template. This is fundamentally different than plotting using a program like Excel, where you first pick your plot type, and then you add your data. With ggplot, you start with data, add a coordinate system, and then add “geoms,” which indicate what type of plot you want. A cool thing about ggplot is that you can add and layer different geoms together, to create a fully customized plot that is exactly what you want. If this sounds nebulous right now, that’s okay, we are going to talk more about this.\nSimplified, we will provide to R:\n\nour data\naesthetics mapped to variables - what connects the data to the graphics\nlayers - determine which type of plot we are going to make, what cordinate system we will use, what scales we want, and other important aspects of our plot\n\nYou can think about a ggplot as being composed of layers. You start with your data, and continue to add layers until you get the plot that you want. This might sound a bit abstract so I am going to talk through this with an example."

This example starts with a dataset from gapminder.org containing population information for many countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the population for Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on the continent of Asia? By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!"

In this lesson, we will teach you some of the fundamentals of the R language and share best practices for organizing code in scientific projects, which will make your life easier.\nThough we could use a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to analyze our data, these tools have limitations in terms of flexibility and accessibility. Moreover, they make it difficult to share the steps involved in exploring and modifying raw data, which is essential for conducting “reproducible” research.\nTherefore, this lesson will guide you on how to start exploring your data using R. R is a program available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and can be freely downloaded from the link provided above. To run R, all you need is the R program.\nHowever, we will be running R inside a fancy editor (or “IDE”, Integrated Development Environment) called RStudio, which makes working with R much more pleasant!\nSince R is open source, there are endlessly available free resource to learn how to do practically whatever you want on the internet."

    "text": "8 Functions in R – and packages\nTo do almost anything in R, you will use “functions” (these are like commands).\nYou can recognize function calls by the parentheses, like in install.packages(). Inside those parentheses, you can provide arguments to a function.\nFor example, install.packages() is an important function you already used if you followed the setup instructions for this workshop: it will install an R package. R packages are basically add-ons or extensions to the functionality of the R language. Inside the parenthese of install.packages(), you should provide a package name as an argument, like install.packages(\"gapminder\").\nAnother example of an R function is library(), which will access your “library” of installed packages to load a package. Every time you want to use a package in R, you need to load it, just like everytime you want to use MS Word on your computer, you need to open it.\nLet’s see if you have the two packages that we will use today installed:\n\nlibrary(gapminder)\n# (No output is expected if the package can be loaded)\n\n\n# (Output like that shown below is expected if the package can be loaded:)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nIf you got an error when trying to load one or both of these packages, you’ll need to install those:\n\n# ONLY run this if you got errors above:\ninstall.packages(\"gapminder\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n8.1 Some other R functions\nAnother important function is c(), which stands for combine or concatenate. With c(), you can create vectors that contain multiple elements, like multiple numbers. You’ll learn more about vectors in the next session, but here is a quick example:\n\nc(10, 15)\n\n[1] 10 15\n\n\nBelow are examples of some other R functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nabs(x)\nabsolute value\n\n\nsqrt(x)\nsquare root\n\n\nround(x , digits= n)\nround(3.475, digits=2) is 3.48\n\n\nlog(x)\nnatural logarithm\n\n\nlog10(x)\ncommon logarithm"

These folders have specific physical locations on your computer, known as paths. Directories are organized hierarchically, and the overall structure of standard directories differs slightly across various operating systems, such as Mac, Windows, and Linux. By using Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows), you can navigate to different locations on your computer, but you can also do so using R code.\nYour working directory is exactly what it sounds like— it is the current location or path on your computer where you are actively working. This is important because, by default, your files will be read from, stored in, and saved to this location. Therefore, it is essential to know where your working directory is.\n\n\n12.2 Find your working directory\nWe can figure out where our working directory is by typing the function getwd() into the console:\ngetwd()\nTBA - ADD YOUR WORKING DIR HORACIO Lopez-Nicora\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectories are separated by / on Mac and by \\ on Windows\n\n\n\nBecause I am using a Mac, directories in my path are separated by forward slashes /, while on Windows machines, they are separated by backslashes \\.\nThat said, when you provide a path to R, like we’ll do below with setwd(), you can use forward slashes on all operating systems!\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Set your working directory\nIf your working directory is not where you want to be, you can change it. We can do that using the function setwd():\nsetwd(\"/this/should/be/your/working-directory/path\")\nFor example, I will change mine to:\nsetwd(\"\") # TBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Projects\n\n\n\nIf you change your working dir in the R console, what is shown in the Files tab in the bottom-right does not automatically follow along. In that case, to show the files in your working dir in the Files tab, click the gear icon in that tab, and select Go To Working Directory.\nHowever, there is a better way of dealing with working directories, which is to avoid using setwd() altogether and to use RStudio Projects instead.\nTo learn more about RStudio Projects, see this section in the free book R for Data Science."

Here, we’ll see the two most common ones: vectors and data frames.\nData types are how R distinguishes between different kinds of data like numbers versus character strings. Here, we’ll talk about the 4 main data types: character, integer, double, and logical.\n\nAn analogy: If we were talking about handling food rather than data, you can think of different data types as different food items, and various data structures as the types of containers that contain them.\n\n\n1.2 Setting up\nTo make it easier to keep track of what we do, we’ll write our code in a script (and send it to the console from there):\n\nOpen a new R script (Click the + symbol in toolbar at the top, then click R Script)1.\nSave the script straight away as data-structures.R.

    "section": "2 Data structure 1: Vectors",
    "text": "2 Data structure 1: Vectors\nThe first data structure we will explore is the simplest: the vector. A vector in R is essentially a collection of one or more items. Moving forward, we’ll call such individual items “elements”.\n\n2.1 Single-element vectors and quoting\nVectors can consist of just a single element, so each of the two lines of code below creates a vector:\n\nvector1 &lt;- 8\nvector2 &lt;- \"panda\"\n\nTwo things are worth noting about the \"panda\" example, which is a so-called character string (or string for short):\n\n\"panda\" constitutes one element, not 5 (its number of letters).\nUnlike when dealing with numbers, we have to quote the string.2\n\nCharacter strings need to be quoted because they are otherwise interpreted as R objects – for example, because our vectors vector1 and vector2 are objects, we refer to them without quotes:\n\n# [Note that R will show auto-complete options after you type 3 characters]\nvector1\n\n[1] 8\n\nvector2\n\n[1] \"panda\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, the code below doesn’t work because there is no object called panda:\n\nvector_fail &lt;- panda\n\nError: object 'panda' not found\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Multi-element vectors\nA common way to make vectors with multiple elements is by using the c (combine) function:\n\nc(2, 6, 3)\n\n[1] 2 6 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike in the first couple of vector examples, we didn’t save the above vector to an object: now the vector simply printed to the console – but it is created all the same.\n\n\n\nc() can also append elements to an existing vector:\n\n# First we create a vector:\nvector_to_append &lt;- c(\"vhagar\", \"meleys\")\nvector_to_append\n\n[1] \"vhagar\" \"meleys\"\n\n# Then we append another element to it:\nc(vector_to_append, \"balerion the dread\")\n\n[1] \"vhagar\"             \"meleys\"             \"balerion the dread\"\n\n\nTo create vectors with series of numbers, a couple of shortcuts are available. First, you can make series of whole numbers (integers) with the : operator:\n\n1:10\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nSecond, you can use a function like seq() and its arguments from (starting value), to (end value), and by (step size) for fine control over the sequence:\n\nmyseq &lt;- seq(from = 6, to = 8, by = 0.2)\nmyseq\n\n [1] 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Vectorization\nConsider the output of this command:\n\nmyseq * 2\n\n [1] 12.0 12.4 12.8 13.2 13.6 14.0 14.4 14.8 15.2 15.6 16.0\n\n\nAbove, every individual element in myseq was multiplied by 2. We call this behavior “vectorization” and this is a key feature of the R language. (Alternatively, you may have expected this code to repeat myseq twice, but this did not happen!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more about vectorization, see episode 9 from the Carpentries lesson that this material is based on.\n\n\n\n\n\n Challenge 1\nA. Start by making a vector x with the whole numbers 1 through 26. Then, subtract 0.5 from each element in the vector and save the result in vector y. Check your results by printing both vectors.\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\nx &lt;- 1:26\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n[26] 26\n\ny &lt;- x - 0.5\ny\n\n [1]  0.5  1.5  2.5  3.5  4.5  5.5  6.5  7.5  8.5  9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5\n[16] 15.5 16.5 17.5 18.5 19.5 20.5 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5\n\n\n\n\nB. What do you think the result of the following operation will be? Try it out and check if you were correct. We didn’t cover this kind of scenario, but go ahead and test your intuition!\n\n1:5 * 1:5\n\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\n1:5 * 1:5\n\n[1]  1  4  9 16 25\n\n\nBoth vectors are of length 5 which will lead to “element-wise matching”: the first element in the first vector will be multiplied with the first element in the second vector, the second element in the first vector will be multiplied with the second element in the second vector, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Exploring vectors\nR has many functions to get information about vectors and other types of objects, such as:\n\nGet the number of elements with length():\n\nlength(myseq)\n\n[1] 11\n\n\nSee the first and last few elements, respectively, with head() and tail():\n\n# Print the first 6 elements:\nhead(myseq)\n\n[1] 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 7.0\n\n# Both head and tail have argument `n` to specify the number of elements:\nhead(myseq, n = 2)\n\n[1] 6.0 6.2\n\n# Print the last 6 elements:\ntail(myseq)\n\n[1] 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0\n\n\nGet arithmetic summaries like sum() and mean() for vectors with numbers:\n\n# sum() will sum the values of all elements\nsum(myseq)\n\n[1] 77\n\n# mean() will compute the mean (average) across all elements\nmean(myseq)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Extracting elements from vectors\nExtracting element from objects like vectors is often referred to as “indexing”. In R, we can do this using bracket notation – for example:\n\nGet the second element:\n\nmyseq[2]\n\n[1] 6.2\n\n\nGet the second through the fifth elements:\n\nmyseq[2:5]\n\n[1] 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8\n\n\nGet the first and eight elements:\n\nmyseq[c(1, 8)]\n\n[1] 6.0 7.4\n\n\n\nTo put this in a general way: we can extract elements from a vector by using another vector, whose values are the positional indices of the elements in the original vector."

Let’s start by making a toy data frame with information about 3 cats:\n\ncats &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Luna\", \"Thomas\", \"Daisy\"),\n  coat = c(\"calico\", \"black\", \"tabby\"),\n  weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2)\n  )\n\ncats\n\n    name   coat weight\n1   Luna calico    2.1\n2 Thomas  black    5.0\n3  Daisy  tabby    3.2\n\n\nAbove:\n\nWe created 3 vectors and pasted them side-by-side to create a data frame in which each vector constitutes a column.\nWe gave each vector a name (e.g., coat), and those names became the column names.\nThe resulting data frame has 3 rows (one for each cat) and 3 columns (each with a type of info about the cats, like coat color).\n\nIt is good practice to organize tabular data in the so-called “tidy” data format like above, where:\n\nEach column contains a different “variable” (e.g. coat color, weight)\nEach row contains a different “observation” (data on e.g. one cat/person/sample)\n\nThat’s all we’ll say about data frames for now, but in today’s remaining sessions we will explore this key R data structure more!"

The behavior of R in various operations will depend heavily on the data type – for example, the below fails:\n\n\"valerion\" * 5\n\nError in \"valerion\" * 5: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nWe can ask what type of data something is in R using the typeof() function:\n\ntypeof(\"valerion\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nR sets the data type of \"valerion\" to character, which we commonly refer to as character strings or strings. In formal terms, the earlier failed command did not work because R does not allow us to perform mathematical functions on vectors of type character.\nThe character data type most commonly contains letters, but anything that is placed between quotes (\"...\") will be interpreted as this data type – even plain numbers:\n\ntypeof(\"5\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nBesides character, the other 3 common data types are:\n\ndouble / numeric – numbers that can have decimal points:\n\ntypeof(3.14)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\ninteger – whole numbers only:\n\ntypeof(1:3)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nlogical (either TRUE or FALSE – unquoted!):\n\ntypeof(TRUE)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 A vector can only contain one data type\nIndividual vectors, and therefore also individual columns in data frames, can only be composed of a single data type.\nR will silently pick the “best-fitting” data type when you enter or read data into a data frame. So let’s see what the data types are in our cats data frame:\n\nstr(cats)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ name  : chr  \"Luna\" \"Thomas\" \"Daisy\"\n $ coat  : chr  \"calico\" \"black\" \"tabby\"\n $ weight: num  2.1 5 3.2\n\n\n\nThe name and coat columns are character, abbreviated chr.\nThe weight column is double/numeric, abbreviated num.\n\n\n Challenge 2\nWhat type of vector (if any) do you think each of the following will produce? Try it out and see if you were right.\n\ntypeof(\"TRUE\")\ntypeof(banana)\ntypeof(c(2, 6, \"3\"))\n\nBonus / trick question:\n\ntypeof(18, 3)\n\n\n\nClick for the solutions\n\n\ntypeof(\"TRUE\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\"TRUE\" is character (and not logical) because of the quotes around it.\n\n\ntypeof(banana)\n\nError: object 'banana' not found\n\n\n\nRecall the earlier example: this returns an error because the object banana does not exist. Any unquoted string (that is not a special keyword like TRUE and FALSE) is interpreted as a reference to an object in R.\n\n\ntypeof(c(2, 6, \"3\"))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nWe’ll talk about why this produces a character vector in the next section.\n\n\ntypeof(18, 3)\n\nError in typeof(18, 3): unused argument (3)\n\n\n\nThis produces an error because the typeof() only accepts a single argument, which is an R object like a vector. Because we did not wrap 18, 3 within c() (i.e. we did not use c(18, 3)), we ended up passing two arguments to the function, and this resulted in an error.\nIf you guessed that it would have TWICE returned integer (or double), you were on the right track: you couldn’t have known that the function does not accept multiple objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Automatic Type Coercion\nR’s behavior of returning a character vector for c(2, 6, \"3\") in the challenge above is called type coercion.\nWhen R encounters a mix of types (here, numbers and characters) to be combined into a single vector, it will force all of them to be the same type. It “must” do this because, as pointed out above, a vector can consist of only a single data type.\nType coercion can be the source of many surprises, and is one reason you need to be aware of the basic R data types and how R will interpret them.\n\n\n4.4 Manual Type Conversion\nLuckily, you are not simply at the mercy of whatever R decides to do automatically, but can convert vectors at will using the as. group of functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to use RStudio’s auto-complete functionality here: type “as.” and then press the Tab key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas.integer(c(\"0\", \"2\"))\n\n[1] 0 2\n\nas.character(c(0, 2))\n\n[1] \"0\" \"2\"\n\n\nAs you may have guessed, though, not all type conversions are possible — for example:\n\nas.double(\"kiwi\")\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n(NA is R’s way of denoting missing data – see this bonus section for more.)\nThat’s it! In the next session, we’ll learn to manipulate and summarize data frames using a real dataset with periodic countrywise statistics such as population size."

    "text": "5 Bonus material for self-study\n\n5.1 Changing vector elements using indexing\nAbove, we saw how you can extract elements of a vector using indexing. To change elements in a vector, simply use the bracket on the other side of the arrow – for example:\n\nChange the first element to 30:\n\nmyseq[1] &lt;- 30\nmyseq\n\n [1] 30.0  6.2  6.4  6.6  6.8  7.0  7.2  7.4  7.6  7.8  8.0\n\n\nChange the last element to 0:\n\nmyseq[length(myseq)] &lt;- 0\nmyseq\n\n [1] 30.0  6.2  6.4  6.6  6.8  7.0  7.2  7.4  7.6  7.8  0.0\n\n\nChange the second element to the mean value of the vector:\n\nmyseq[2] &lt;- mean(myseq)\nmyseq\n\n [1] 30.000000  8.454545  6.400000  6.600000  6.800000  7.000000  7.200000\n [8]  7.400000  7.600000  7.800000  0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Extracting columns from a data frame\nYou can extract individual columns from a data frame using the $ operator:\n\ncats$weight\n\n[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2\n\ncats$coat\n\n[1] \"calico\" \"black\"  \"tabby\" \n\n\nThis kind of operation will return a vector – and can be indexed as well:\n\ncats$weight[2]\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Factors\nCategorical data, like treatments in an experiment, can be stored as “factors” in R. Factors are useful for statistical analyses and for plotting, e.g. because they allow you to specify a custom order.\n\ndiet_vec &lt;- c(\"high\", \"medium\", \"low\", \"low\", \"medium\")\ndiet_vec\n\n[1] \"high\"   \"medium\" \"low\"    \"low\"    \"medium\"\n\nfactor(diet_vec)\n\n[1] high   medium low    low    medium\nLevels: high low medium\n\n\nIn the example above, we turned a character vector into a factor. Its “levels” (low, medium, high) are sorted alphabetically by default, but we can manually specify an order that makes more sense:\n\ndiet_fct &lt;- factor(diet_vec, levels = c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\ndiet_fct\n\n[1] high   medium low    low    medium\nLevels: low medium high\n\n\nThis ordering would be automatically respected in plots and statistical analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOddly, factors are technically not a data type (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most intents and purposes, it makes sense to think of factors as another data type, even though technically, they are a kind of data structure build on the integer data type:\n\ntypeof(diet_fct)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 More on the logical data type\nAdd a column to your cats data frame that indicates whether each cat does or does not like string:\n\ncats$likes_string &lt;- c(1, 0, 1)\ncats\n\n    name   coat weight likes_string\n1   Luna calico    2.1            1\n2 Thomas  black    5.0            0\n3  Daisy  tabby    3.2            1\n\n\nSo, likes_string is numeric, but the 1s and 0s actually represent TRUE and FALSE.\nYou could instead use the logical data type here, by converting this column with the as.logical() function. That will turn 0’s into FALSE and everything else, including 1, to TRUE:\n\nas.logical(cats$likes_string)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nTo actually modify this column in the dataframe itself:\n\ncats$likes_string &lt;- as.logical(cats$likes_string)\ncats\n\n    name   coat weight likes_string\n1   Luna calico    2.1         TRUE\n2 Thomas  black    5.0        FALSE\n3  Daisy  tabby    3.2         TRUE\n\n\nYou might think that 1/0 could be a handier coding than TRUE/FALSE because that enables easy counting of the number of times something is true or false. But consider the following R behavior:\n\nTRUE + TRUE\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nSo, logicals can be used as if they were numbers, where FALSE represents 0 and TRUE represents 1.\n\n\n5.5 Missing values (NA)\nR has a concept of missing data, which is important in statistical computing, as not all information/measurements are always available for each sample.\nIn R, missing values are coded as NA (like TRUE/FALSE, this is not a character string so it is not quoted):\n\n# This vector will contain one missing value\nvector_NA &lt;- c(1, 3, NA, 7)\nvector_NA\n\n[1]  1  3 NA  7\n\n\nNotably, many functions operating on vectors will return NA if any element in the vector is NA:\n\nsum(vector_NA)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nYou can get around this is by setting na.rm = TRUE in such functions, for example:\n\nsum(vector_NA, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 11\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Learn more\nTo learn more about data types and data structures, see this episode from a separate Carpentries lesson.\n\n\n Bonus Challenge\nAn important part of every data analysis is cleaning input data. Here, you will clean a cat data set that has an added observation with a problematic data entry.\nStart by creating the new data frame:\n\ncats_v2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Luna\", \"Thomas\", \"Daisy\", \"Oliver\"),\n  coat = c(\"calico\", \"black\", \"tabby\", \"tabby\"),\n  weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2, \"2.3 or 2.4\")\n)\n\nThen move on to the tasks below, filling in the blanks (_____) and running the code:\n\n# 1. Explore the data frame,\n#    including with an overview that shows the columns' data types:\ncats_v2\n_____(cats_v2)\n\n# 2. The \"weight\" column has the incorrect data type _____.\n#    The correct data type is: _____.\n\n# 3. Correct the 4th weight with the mean of the two given values,\n#    then print the data frame to see the effect:\ncats_v2$weight[4] &lt;- 2.35\ncats_v2\n\n# 4. Convert the weight column to the right data type:\ncats_v2$weight &lt;- _____(cats_v2$weight)\n\n# 5. Calculate the mean weight of the cats:\n_____\n\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\n# 1. Explore the data frame,\n#    including with an overview that shows the columns' data types:\ncats_v2\n\n    name   coat     weight\n1   Luna calico        2.1\n2 Thomas  black          5\n3  Daisy  tabby        3.2\n4 Oliver  tabby 2.3 or 2.4\n\nstr(cats_v2)\n\n'data.frame':   4 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ name  : chr  \"Luna\" \"Thomas\" \"Daisy\" \"Oliver\"\n $ coat  : chr  \"calico\" \"black\" \"tabby\" \"tabby\"\n $ weight: chr  \"2.1\" \"5\" \"3.2\" \"2.3 or 2.4\"\n\n# 2. The \"weight\" column has the incorrect data type CHARACTER.\n#    The correct data type is: DOUBLE/NUMERIC.\n\n# 3. Correct the 4th weight data point with the mean of the two given values,\n#    then print the data frame to see the effect:\ncats_v2$weight[4] &lt;- 2.35\ncats_v2\n\n    name   coat weight\n1   Luna calico    2.1\n2 Thomas  black      5\n3  Daisy  tabby    3.2\n4 Oliver  tabby   2.35\n\n# 4. Convert the weight column to the right data type:\ncats_v2$weight &lt;- as.double(cats_v2$weight)\n\n# 5. Calculate the mean weight of the cats:\nmean(cats_v2$weight)\n\n[1] 3.1625"
