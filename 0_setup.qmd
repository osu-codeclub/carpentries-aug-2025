------------------------------------------------------------------------

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

Before the workshop starts, you'll need to install **R** (the programming language),
**RStudio** (the editor/IDE we'll use to interact with R),
and if you can, two **R packages**.
The instructions to do so follow below.

### Having trouble with the installation?
Consider using Posit Cloud to run RStudio in your browser,
as detailed [at the bottom of this page](##using-posit-cloud).

## Install R and RStudio

### Alternative 1: If you have an OSU-managed computer

If you are using an OSU computer,
you may not have the "administrative privileges" that are needed to install software
on your computer the regular way.

However, you should in that case have an OSU application on your computer that
allows you to install a selection of approved software,
including R and RStudio.
On Windows, this app should be called "Software Center",
and on Mac, "Ohio State Application Self Service".

Find that application and inside it, install R and RStudio using this app.

### Alternative 2: If you have a personal computer

_Below, there's a separate tab with installation instructions for each operating system:_ 

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Windows

Installation on Windows:

1. Install R: download and run [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm)
   from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).

2. Install RStudio: Click the download button below "Install RStudio" on
   [this page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

::: callout-warning
## Install as administrator if possible
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts,
you should run the installers as administrator
(right-click on the `.exe` file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking).
Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

## MacOS

Installation on MacOS:

1. Install R: download and run [this .pkg file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg)
   from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).

2. Install RStudio:
   Click the download button below "Install RStudio" on [this page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

## Linux

Installation on Linux:

1. Install R:
   Instructions for R installation on various Linux platforms
   (Debian, Fedora, Redhat, and Ubuntu) can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/>.

2. Install RStudio:
   Click the download button below "Install RStudio" on [this page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

## Install two R packages

If you are comfortable doing so, please install two so-called R packages
(basically, add-ons to the functionality of the language)
that we will be using during the workshop, which you do as follows:

1. Open RStudio on your computer

2. In RStudio, find the R "Console": this is the primary tab in the (bottom) left panel

3. Type or paste the following commands in the R Console,
   pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Return</kbd>) after each:

   - `install.packages("gapminder")`
   - `install.packages("tidyverse")`

4. You should see a bunch of text stream by in the Console while these packages
   are being installed. When it's done,
   test that the packages were successfully installed by _loading_ them:

   - `library(gapminder)`
   - `library(tidyverse)`
    
  The first command should produce no output, but the second should,
  similar to what's shown in this screenshot:

If you got an error instead when loading one or both packages,
please [contact one of the instructors](./about.qmd#instructors-and-organizers).

## Using Posit Cloud
